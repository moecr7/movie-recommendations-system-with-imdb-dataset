# Project Title

## Overview

This project contains a dataset represented as a dictionary of items, where each item is associated with a numerical value. The data is structured as tuples, with the first element being an identifier and the second element being a corresponding score or metric. This dataset can be useful for various applications, including data analysis, machine learning, and statistical modeling.

## Data Structure

The dataset is structured as follows:

- Each entry in the dictionary consists of a tuple where:
  - The first element (e.g., `(75,)`) is an identifier (which could represent an index, ID, or category).
  - The second element (e.g., `0.8272781516947562`) is a numerical value associated with that identifier, representing a score, probability, or other metrics.

### Example Data

Here are a few examples of the data structure:

```python
data = {
    (75,): 0.8272781516947562,
    (106,): 0.5860090386731182,
    (686,): 0.8320502943378437,
    (815,): 0.5765566601970551,
    (1040,): 0.9434563530497265,
    ...
}
```

## Usage

To utilize this dataset in your project, you can import it as follows:

```python
# Example of importing the data
data = {
    (75,): 0.8272781516947562,
    (106,): 0.5860090386731182,
    ...
}

# Accessing a specific value
value = data[(75,)]
print(value)  # Output: 0.8272781516947562
```

## Applications

This dataset can be applied in various fields, including but not limited to:

- **Data Analysis**: Analyzing trends and patterns based on the numerical values.
- **Machine Learning**: Using the values as features for predictive modeling.
- **Statistical Research**: Conducting statistical tests or analyses based on the provided metrics.

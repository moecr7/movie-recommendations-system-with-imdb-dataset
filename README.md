# Project Title  

## Overview  

This project contains a collection of data points represented as a dictionary of items, where each item is associated with a numerical value. The data appears to be structured as tuples, with the first element being an identifier and the second element being a corresponding score or metric. This could be useful for various applications, such as data analysis, machine learning, or statistical modeling.  

## Data Structure  

The data is structured as follows:  

- Each entry in the dictionary consists of a tuple where:  
  - The first element (e.g., `(75,)`) is an identifier (could represent an index, ID, or category).  
  - The second element (e.g., `0.8272781516947562`) is a numerical value associated with that identifier, which may represent a score, probability, or some other metric.  

### Example Data  

Here are a few examples of the data structure:  

```python  
data = {  
    (75,): 0.8272781516947562,  
    (106,): 0.5860090386731182,  
    (686,): 0.8320502943378437,  
    ...  
}
